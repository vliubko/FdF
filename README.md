# FdF @ UNIT Factory
First graphic project in UNIT Factory (school 42).
A simple 3D height-map renderer. You can rotate, move and zoom models.

Use of MiniLibX library.

## Features
* Simple file format definition (array of space-separated integers)
* 3D rotations with the keys
* Camera controls (zoom, translate)

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run it with `./fdf [map]`. A bunch of sample maps are provided in the `maps`
directory.

Controls are available by pressing `Tab`.
